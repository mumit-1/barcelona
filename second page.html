    <p>The 2010/11 season was FC Barcelona's 111th in existence and the club's 80th consecutive season in the top flight of Spanish football. Barcelona started the season with a new president after Joan Laporta reached his term limit on 30 June, leaving behind a very successful club tenure.

        Sandro Rosell was elected president on 13 June by securing a record total of 35,021 votes (61.35%), more than the 27,138 achieved by Laporta in 2003. Rosell began his tenure on 1 July as the 39th president in Barcelona's history.[2]
        
        This team is widely considered to be one of the greatest club sides of all time.[3][4] Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has described this squad as the best he had ever faced.[5]</p>
